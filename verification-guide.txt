# CLAUDE FILE UPLOAD VERIFICATION KIT

Version 1.0 | October 18, 2025

## BACKGROUND

On October 17-18, 2025, new file upload capabilities were discovered on Claude.ai
including support for video, audio, archives, and expanded file limits. This kit
helps verify if these features are available in your region/account.

## DISCOVERED FEATURES

✓ Video uploads (.mp4, .mov, .avi)
✓ Audio uploads (.mp3, .m4a, .wav)
✓ Archive uploads (.zip, .tar, .gz)
✓ Document uploads (.pages, .docx, .srt)
✓ File limit expansion (5 → 14+ files per conversation)
✓ ZIP content parsing (can read files inside archives)
✓ Video metadata extraction (duration, resolution, fps)
✓ MCP connector ecosystem (Hugging Face, GitHub, Google Drive, Invideo)
✓ Cross-conversation search tools

## REQUIREMENTS

Account: Claude Pro recommended (free tier untested)
Platform: Desktop web browser (claude.ai)
- Mobile web works but may have limitations
- Native mobile apps may not have features yet
Browser: Any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
Mode: Private/Incognito browsing recommended for clean testing

## TEST FILES INCLUDED

1. test_basic.txt (200 bytes)
- Simple text file for basic upload verification
1. test_zip_parsing.zip (1.6 KB)
- Contains: README.txt, index.html, data.json
- Tests ZIP extraction and content parsing
1. (User supplies) test_video.mp4 (under 30MB)
- Any short video clip for metadata extraction testing
- Recommended: 10-30 seconds, common format

# VERIFICATION SEQUENCE

## TEST 1: BASIC FILE UPLOAD

Goal: Verify Claude accepts file uploads

Steps:

1. Open claude.ai in your browser
1. Start a new conversation
1. Click the attachment icon (paperclip/plus button)
1. Upload test_basic.txt
1. Ask: "Can you read this file and tell me what it says?"

Expected Result:
✓ File uploads successfully
✓ Claude reads and summarizes content
✓ Claude confirms test date (October 18, 2025)

If this fails: File uploads are not available in your region/account yet

## TEST 2: ZIP CONTENT PARSING

Goal: Verify Claude can extract and read files inside ZIP archives

Steps:

1. Start a new conversation (or continue from Test 1)
1. Upload test_zip_parsing.zip
1. Ask: "List all files in this ZIP"
1. Ask: "What is the magic_number in the data.json file?"
1. Ask: "How many files does the README say are in this ZIP?"

Expected Results:
✓ Claude lists: README.txt, index.html, data.json
✓ Claude reports magic_number = 42
✓ Claude reports 3 files mentioned in README

If this fails: ZIP uploads accepted but not fully parsed

## TEST 3: VIDEO METADATA EXTRACTION

Goal: Verify Claude can process video files and extract metadata

Requirements:

- You need to provide your own short video (under 30MB)
- MP4 format recommended
- 10-30 seconds long is ideal

Steps:

1. Start a new conversation
1. Upload your test video
1. Ask: "What are the technical specs of this video?"
1. Ask: "How long is the video and what resolution is it?"

Expected Results:
✓ Claude reports accurate duration
✓ Claude reports resolution (e.g., 1920x1080)
✓ Claude reports frame rate if available
✓ Claude confirms audio presence/absence

Note: Claude cannot hear audio or watch video content, but can:

- Extract metadata (duration, resolution, fps, codec)
- Sample and analyze individual frames
- Read visual elements (text, UI, objects in frames)

## TEST 4: CONNECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Goal: Verify file uploads work regardless of connector state

Steps:

1. Go to Settings → Connectors
1. Note which connectors are currently enabled
1. Disconnect ALL connectors (GitHub, Google Drive, etc.)
1. Return to a new conversation
1. Upload any test file (test_basic.txt works fine)
1. Verify Claude can still process it

Expected Result:
✓ File uploads work with no connectors enabled
✓ File processing is native functionality

Conclusion: File uploads are NOT dependent on MCP connectors

## TEST 5: FILE LIMIT TESTING

Goal: Determine maximum number of simultaneous file uploads

Steps:

1. Start a new conversation
1. Try uploading 5 files at once
1. If successful, try 10 files
1. If successful, try 14 files
1. Note where it stops accepting

Expected Results (as of Oct 18, 2025):
✓ Originally: 5 file limit
✓ Increased to: 6 files (observed during rollout)
✓ Further increased to: 14 files
✓ May vary by account/region

Your result: _____ files maximum

## TEST 6: PRIVATE BROWSING VERIFICATION

Goal: Confirm features work in clean environment (no cache/cookies)

Steps:

1. Open Private/Incognito browser window
1. Go to claude.ai
1. Log in
1. Repeat Test 1 (basic file upload)

Expected Result:
✓ Features work in private browsing
✓ Confirms server-side functionality, not browser-cached

If this fails: Features may be experimental/unstable

# TROUBLESHOOTING

Issue: Can’t find file upload button
Solution:

- Check you’re on claude.ai web version (not mobile app)
- Look for paperclip icon or plus button near message input
- Try refreshing the page

Issue: File upload button is grayed out
Solution:

- Features may not be rolled out to your region yet
- Try private browsing mode
- Try different browser
- Check if you’re on Pro tier

Issue: Files upload but Claude says "I cannot process this file type"
Solution:

- Feature may be partially rolled out
- File type might genuinely not be supported yet
- Try a different file type

Issue: ZIP uploads but content not parsed
Solution:

- This is a known limitation in early rollout
- Feature may be being tested incrementally
- Try smaller ZIP files (<5MB)

Issue: Video uploads but no metadata extracted
Solution:

- Claude may accept but not process video yet
- Try more common formats (MP4, MOV)
- Check file size (under 30MB recommended)
